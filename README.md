# WASA
### git repository for WASAtext project
[*Web And Software Architecture*](https://gamificationlab.uniroma1.it/en/wasa/) is a course I have been attending at Sapienza University of Rome during the academic year 2025/2026 during my Erasmus+ exchange program.  

The main goal of the course is to create a web application project called *WASAtext*, which is a basic communication platform that allows users to send messages, create channels, and interact with each other. 

The procject is developed stage by stage according to the course syllabus: 
1. define APIs using the OpenAPI standard
2. design and develop the server side (“backend”) in Go
3. design and develop the client side (“frontend”) in JavaScript
4. create a Docker container image for deployment

## 1. OpenAPI

All API endpoints and schemas are defined in *OpenAPI* specification.
